# **Project Description** 
**Classify Song Genres from Audio Data** 

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), we will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com/) (now part of Spotify). We will first make use of `pandas` and `seaborn` packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors we should be aware of when doing machine learning. Next, you will use the `scikit-learn` package to predict whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. We will go over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.

## Project Tasks

* Preparing our dataset
* Pairwise relationships between continuous variables
* Normalizing the feature data
* Principal Component Analysis on our scaled data
* Further visualization of PCA
* Train a decision tree to classify genre
* Compare our decision tree to a logistic regression
* Balance our data for greater performance
* Does balancing our dataset improve model bias?
* Using cross-validation to evaluate our models
