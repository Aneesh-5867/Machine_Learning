# **Project Description** 
**Visualizing COVID-19 in R** 

Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this free R project, we will visualize data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.

## Project Tasks

* From epidemic to pandemic
* Confirmed cases throughout the world
* China compared to the rest of the world
* Let's annotate!
* Adding a trend line to China
* And the rest of the world?
* Adding a logarithmic scale
* Which countries outside of China have been hit hardest?
* Plotting hardest hit countries as of Mid-March 2020
