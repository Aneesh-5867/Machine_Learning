# Machine Learning and Deep Learning 
This repository contains the resources which I have referred to while learning machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). 

## EE769 (Introduction to Machine Learning) 

I credited a course named **Introduction to Machine Learning** ([EE769](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/courses/EE769)) at IIT Bombay (Spring 2020 semester). [Prof. Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/) was the instructor of this course.  Unfortunately, this course could not be completed due to [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). There were two assignments in this course: 

1. Implementing Support vector machine (SVM) from scratch 
2. Predicting employee attrition using a binary classifier 

The problem statements and code files for the above mentioned two assignments are available in the folder named [Assignments](https://github.com/SudhakarKuma/Machine_Learning/tree/master/EE769/Assignments). For the final evaluation of this course, I worked on a project titled [Sales Prediction for Big Mart Outlets](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/). This project is one of the machine learning competitions organized by **Analytics Vidhya**, in which I participated and could manage to get in the top 18\% (630/3638) of the submissions. The detailed approach of this project is available in the folder named [Sales-Prediction-for-Big-Mart-Outlets](https://github.com/SudhakarKuma/Machine_Learning/tree/master/EE769/Projects/Sales-Prediction-for-Big-Mart-OutletsSales-Prediction-for-Big-Mart-Outlets). 

While crediting the course EE769, the following books were instrumental in digesting the underlying principles of ML: 

* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
* [Practical Deep Learning for Cloud, Mobile, and Edge: Real-World AI & Computer-Vision Projects Using Python, Keras & TensorFlow](https://pages.dataiku.com/hubfs/o-reilly-deep-learning.pdf)
* [The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
* [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms by Shai Ben-David and Shai Shalev-Shwartz](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf)

Some of these books are freely available on the Internet. 

## ME781 (Engineering Data Mining and Applications)
In the fall semester (August 2020), I am crediting another course named **Engineering Data Mining and Applications** (ME781), at IIT Bombay. [Prof. Asim Tiwari](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/?q=faculty/Prof.%20Asim%20Tewari) is the instructor of this course. The assignments of this course are available in the folder named [ME781](https://github.com/SudhakarKuma/Machine_Learning/tree/master/ME781)

## DataCamp 

In the summers of 2020, I completed one career track, named **[Machine Learning Scientist with Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python)** on DataCamp. Additionally, I finished a few more courses as given below. 

* [Human Resources Analytics: Predicting Employee Churn in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/human-resources-analytics-predicting-employee-churn-in-python)
* [Introduction to SQL](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql)

The slides used in the courses mentioned above, code files, datasets, cheat sheets, etc. are accessible in the folder named [DataCamp_Notes](https://github.com/SudhakarKuma/Machine_Learning/tree/master/DataCamp_Notes). 

After finishing the ML/DL courses, I completed a few projects using Python on [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects), as given below.

* [Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/462)
* [Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort?](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/504)
* [Na√Øve Bees: Predict Species from Images](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/412)
* [Classify Song Genres from Audio Data](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/449)
* [ASL Recognition with Deep Learning](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/509)
* [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/558)
* [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/619)
* [Do Left-handed People Really Die Young?](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/479)

Additionally, I did a project on [visualizing COVID19](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/870) using the R programming language. 

The notebooks and the datasets of these projects are accessible in the folder named [DataCamp_Projects](https://github.com/SudhakarKuma/Machine_Learning/tree/master/DataCamp_Projects). 

## Summer School (IIIT Hyderabad)
    
In July 2019, I attended the [4th Summer School on Machine Learning](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/mlsummerschool2019/), hosted by IIIT Hyderabad. The slides and relevant research papers used in this summer school are accessible in the folder [Summer_School_IIIT_Hyd](https://github.com/SudhakarKuma/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Summer_School_IIIT_Hyd). 

## Online resources 

While looking for regular doubts in ML/Python, I found some of the online resources very lucid. All these resources are available in the markdown file named `Online-resources.md`.
